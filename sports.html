            <p>My all time favourite sport is hockey. 
            I was on the ice before I even learned how to walk.
            I believe it is the best sport our human race has ever come up with. 
            You can never get bored of it. That is why it is the best sport ever.

              My second favourite sport is soccer. Soccer is always my number one sport to play in the summer time. I always play it at school. Those are the reasons it is my second favourite.
